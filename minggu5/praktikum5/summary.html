            <summary>Definition</summary>
            <p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
                Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the
                word is used.

            <summary>Common elements</summary>
            <p>The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of
                football: carrying codes like American football,
                Canadian football, Australian football, rugby union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the
                field
                while being held in the hands or thrown, and kicking codes such as Association football and Gaelic
                football,
                where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited.
